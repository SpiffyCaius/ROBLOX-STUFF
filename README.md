Verious stuff for ROBLOX.

I've formerly been on the game for 15 years since October of 2009 and started devloping in late 2018 when I messed around with code.

Due to my mental illness, my physical health and me not being interested in the game anymore, as I want to take my skills outside of ROBLOX and the fact I'm happy to make something with Apple Script to experiment and sharpen my knowledge compared to not being happy with any of my stuff in ROBLOX studio anymore for awhile now...

I have decided to retire as of October 2024 and move on with getting mental help, and still trying to recover post op.

To be frank I only stayed on ROBLOX this long without playing with friends much because I was isolating myself due to past actions with abuse. Used it as a way to cope and distract myself except that didn't work. It just made things worse for me but finally am getting help since september, tho the week after I started getting help I also had a medical issue with my appendix having to be removed which was the final nail in the coffin since i don't wanna sit and torture myself through a game that's not fun or making something that isn't fun at a desk i'm not even supposed to sit at for te time being. I initially wanted to make money so i stayed even longer but that backfired entirely so yeah i'm done outside of playing with feiends every now and then that ask, I don't intend to come on other than that and I intend to spend more of my time on github and writing my own projects and seeing if people would be interested in it or not. And if im not coding for my particular project well it's probably art then; so you'd see that posted else where obivously, i'd put more time into learning blender, kirta and clip studio paint.

Outside of Apple Script, I have taken up a huge animation project I'm beginning to work on throughout the next few months and I've been so happy a lot more than wasting my time in isolation on ROBLOX bc of my mental illness and my tendency to abuse the s#!+ outta people that frankly don't deserve it, not worth living this way anymore.

This repo will no longer be used, Ill also be retiring the Spiffington Studios branding and my Spiffycaius name. You will now know me as "caidoesstuff" or "caisstuff" depending on the website. (I still need to make a theme for that tho I do plan on sticking with aquatic/cyan themed colors) cuz i ain't going to continue wearing that badge of shame either.

p.s yes I know there's gon be ppl that say 'oh well it's just apple script'- that's not the point, Ill learn new languages eventually but currently I'm just having fun with coding again as it hasn't been fun for awhile now, there are also some that will probably make remarks, just please understand I'm trying to get better.
